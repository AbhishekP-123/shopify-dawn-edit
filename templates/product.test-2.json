However, a UFOMOESTAR leash is built to withstand up to 90 kg of force! This means that if you have a dog heavier than 30 kg, but one who isn't prone to sudden jerks or sprints, you could easily use a UFOMOESTAR leash to walk them. If you have a very active dog that likes to chase other dogs or in general jerks a lot then it's best not to exceed the 30 kg barrier. The maximum leash length is 3 meters or 9 ft. The diameter of the inner circle is 8.6cm .<br\/><strong>Chewing<\/strong><\/p><p>Of course, if your puppy has a habit of chewing on their leash our countless hours of engineering and testing has meant your leash will fade over time. That's why UFOMoestar Leash is designed so you can easily replace the end part of the leash, making sure it stays as reliable as when you first got it.<\/p>",
